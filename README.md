# OOP Template Engine - Employee Summary

  One of the most important aspects of programming is writing code that is readable, reliable, and maintainable. Oftentimes, how we design our code is just as important as the code itself. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Since testing is a key piece in making code maintainable, you will also be ensuring that all unit tests pass.
  
## Instructions

  Getting started with the application you first must install the NPM packages by typing in  `npm i`  in the terminal.
  After the installion, you will be given prompts to gather the Employee's information and role. (Each role will be given       certain prompts based off their position). Once all prompts have been answered you may answer the next prompt to add another   Employee.
